## My process

  

### Built with

  

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- CSS Grid

- Mobile-first workflow

- Javascript

- JQuery


### What I learned

  

This project helped me understand how to make my website responsive with changing screen-size and to position various component of the accordion using CSS Grid display.

I also practiced how to use JQuery along with javascript to design an accordion.

##### CSS Snippet for position the components of the accordion:
```css
.accordian{
display: grid;
grid-template-rows: 150px  auto;
margin-top: 3rem;
background-color: #fff;
border-radius: 20px;
width: 300px;
min-height: 500px;
box-shadow: 0  20px  25px  -10px  hsl(237, 12%, 33%);
max-width: 1000px;
}

```
